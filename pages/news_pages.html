                <p>Turkey officially withdrew on Thursday from an international
                    treaty to prevent violence against women, enacting a decision that drew condemnation from many Turks
                    and Western allies when
                    President Tayyip Erdogan announced it in March.</p>

                <p> Thousands were set to protest across Turkey, where a court appeal to halt the withdrawal was
                    rejected this
                    week.
                    "We will continue our struggle," Canan Gullu, president of the Federation of Turkish Women's
                    Associations,
                    said on Wednesday. "Turkey is shooting itself in the foot with this decision."</p>

                <p>South Africa's government is considering allowing women to have
                    multiple husbands, a possibility that has thrown the country's conservatives into uproar.</p>

                <p>The proposal to allow polyandry was included in a green paper from South Africa's Department of Home
                    Affairs, which hopes to make marriage more inclusive.
                    The option is just one of several in a wide-ranging document, but it has caused intense debate in
                    South Africa.
                    Polygamy, where men marry multiple wives, is legal in the country.</p>

                    the next level.</p>
                <p>India's technology minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said on Friday that he was denied access to his
                    Twitter account for almost an hour.
                    "Friends! Something highly peculiar happened today," the minister said in one of the seven tweets he
                    posted about the incident. "Twitter denied access to my account for almost an hour on the alleged
                    ground that there was a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the USA and
                    subsequently they allowed me to access the account."</p>
